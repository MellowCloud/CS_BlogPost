## The Economic, Environmental, and Social Impact of NFTs

### What is an NFT?

An NFT, or Non-Fungible Token, are a part of the Etherium blockchain. It's a lot
of new words, which might be confusing at first, but let's delve in. Etherium
is a cryptocurrency and blockchain is a database shared among nodes of a computer
network. 1 Etherium (at the time of writing) is worth approximately $4,700 USD.
As for NFTs itself, the Non-Fungible aspect means it's irreplicable. Like
a one of a kind trading card. So, if one traded an NFT to another, they would have
a different item now, whereas trading something like bitcoin, it would be exactly
the same. The token aspect, means it is a tradeable asset.

### Okay, what's the point of it?

At present, people involved in NFTs are claiming it is meant for art, with the art
piece being associated with this NFT. Some NFTs have sold for millions of dollars, like
this piece from the digital artist known as Beeple, selling for $69.3 million.
The way someone owns this token boils down to say "*I* own this art, nobody else does."<br/>
However, although this is the case, the artist could just as easy produce 50 (if not more)
of the same artwork across 50 different NFTs, and still market them as unique.

### Okay, that's a big price tag, but is there anything actually bad about this?

As a matter of fact, yes. There's a few things that would make one consider NFTs to be bad.

#### 1. The Economic Impact

The major economic "feature" of NFTs is the relative anonymity due to the blockchain
technology. However, this anonymity has given rise to an environment for money laundering
and other negative economic effects. 

##### 1. Phishing

First, as is everything on the internet, phishing and virus attacks are prevalent. A key feature
of cryptocurrency fueled marketplaces is decentralization, which makes it incredibly difficult to
track the fraud. Meaning, it's much harder to re-acquire your assets if they're stolen as compared
to something like a fraudulent purchase via your stolen credit card information.

##### 2. Fraud

Earlier in 2021, a seller posed as the street artist Banksy and sold nearly $1 million in NFT art work
before the artist found out and announced he had nothing to do with this. The fraud was blocked from the
site, but still kept the money. 

##### 3. Forgeries

Earlier, I mentioned the NFT that sold for $69.3 million. Following the sale of this NFT, another artist
created matching copies of the NFT and tricked several platforms into believing they were the
original and listing them. Although they were taken down shortly after, they were still
listed nonetheless.

Finally, someone looking to launder dirty money could easily generate an NFT anonymously, list it for sale
the purchase it from themselves using a seperate anonymous digital wallet, and realize this money
as legitimate funds from sale of an artwork.

#### 2. The Environmental Impact

The second major affect caused by NFTs is the amount of energy necessary to create
one. Just one transaction utilizes roughly 35 kWh, which is more than
the average US household uses per day (approx 28 kWh). However, NFTs also involve minting, bidding,
selling, and transferring its respective token, all of which added together average
about 369 kWh, or about 12 days of power for one house. <br/>
The energy cost is solely on the amount of transactions, not the NFTs monetary value.

#### 3. The Social Impact
