## The Economic, Environmental, and Social Impact of NFTs

### What is an NFT?

An NFT, or Non-Fungible Token, are a part of the Etherium blockchain. It's a lot
of new words, which might be confusing at first, but let's delve in. Etherium
is a cryptocurrency and blockchain is a database shared among nodes of a computer
network. 1 Etherium (at the time of writing) is worth approximately $4,700 USD.
As for NFTs itself, the Non-Fungible aspect means it's irreplicable. Like
a one of a kind trading card. So, if one traded an NFT to another, they would have
a different item now, whereas trading something like bitcoin, it would be exactly
the same. The token aspect, means it is a tradeable asset.

### Okay, what's the point of it?

At present, people involved in NFTs are claiming it is meant for art, with the art
piece being associated with this NFT. Some NFTs have sold for millions of dollars, like
this piece from the digital artist known as Beeple, selling for $69m.
The way someone owns this token boils down to say "*I* own this art, nobody else does."

### But isn't that the point of intellectual property?

Yes. Yes it is.
